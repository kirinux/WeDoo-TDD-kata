Each wedoogift user has an account in which he receives money from his company. We call it an endowment.

example:

A user A receives a giftDistribution of gift cards in the amount of 100 euros from his company. he will therefore have â‚¬
100 in gift cards in his account.

The giftDistribution of gift cards has a lifespan of 365 days, beyond this period it will no longer be counted in the
user's walletBalance.

* Implement the function to distribute gift cards to the user by the company if the company walletBalance allows it.
* Implement the function to calculate the user's walletBalance.
