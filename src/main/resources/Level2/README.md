# Level 2

We currently want to allow the user to benefit from restaurant cards. Distributions of meal vouchers work the same way
as giftDistributions of gift vouchers with an exception on the validity date. In fact, meal vouchers expire at the end
of February of the year following the date of giftDistribution.

For example: if the date of the giftDistribution is 01/01/2020, the end of the giftDistribution is 02/28/2021.

Likewise, if the giftDistribution starts on 01/15/2020 it will also end on 02/28/2021.

- Implement the function allowing the company to distribute meal vouchers.
- Use this function to generate the expected result in the output-expected.json file.
